# MLRacer
This project is inspired by the work of Assistant Professor [Madhur Behl](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/madhur-behl) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia and uses a modified version of [HueRacer](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/HueJumper2k) by [Frank Force](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel).

# Why Autonomous Racing?
Training machines to be agile and performant at their physical limits can improve safety in public roads through both autonomous and driver-assisted systems that can avoid accidents. 

# Perception
Autonomous driving systems need to solve three problems:
1. Perception
1. Planning
1. Control

This project focuses on the first problem, perception. That is given a driver's point-of-view, can a model be trained to identify the vehicles position, speed, and trajectory on the road?
